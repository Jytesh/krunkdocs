When uploading any custom assets or using them in your game, make sure that you have the legal right to do so. Its always better to check the license.

<br><br/>

## 3D Models

You can upload custom 3D Models to use in your scene. Currently only .obj and .gtlf are supported. You can load a 3D asset into your scene using KrunkScript:


```krunkscript
# add object
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addAsset(
    x, # num x position
    y, # num x position
    z, # num x position
    scl, # num scale
    aid, # str assetID
    colr, # str color (optional)
);

# update texture
cube.setTexture("assetID");
```

<br><br/>

## Textures & Images

Textures & Images can be used to render an image on a 3D asset or on the [Overlay Canvas](./files/rendering_2d?id=overlay-canvas). Currently only .png images are supported.

--- 

You can update an objects texture using KrunkScript:

```krunkscript
# add object
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube("", "#fff", 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10);

# update texture
cube.texture = "assetID"; # new asset id
```

<br><br/>

## Animations

Animations can be used to add life to your scene. To use animations on models, please use the .gltf format. For an asset to use animations it must have clips attached to the model. When attempting to play an animation, make sure youre using the correct name of the clip. You have a few options for playing animations on an asset:

---

<div class="disBar">Currently Disabled</div>

___

**Using KrunkScript:**

<p class="hidep"><strong class="client-side">client-side</strong></p>

```krunkscript
# play a clip (asset, clipName, repetitions)
GAME.ANIM.playClip(
    asset, # obj
    clipName, # str
    reps # num
);

# stop a clip (asset, clipName)
GAME.ANIM.stopClip(
    asset, # obj
    clipName # str
);
```

___

**Using Triggers:** You can use the following [Trigger Actions](./files/trigger_logic?id=trigger-actions) to interact with animations:
 * **Play Animation:** Plays a clip by name on interface objects
For more information on using triggers, refer to the [Triggers](./files/trigger_logic) section.

___

Override: Krunker also has a few default animations that are linked to player events:

 * **Idle:** Loops while player is idle
 * **Move:** Loops while player is moving
 * **Crouch:** Loops while player is crouched
 * **Jump:** Plays when player jumps
 * **Melee:** Plays when player melees
 * **Shoot:** Plays when player shoots
These animations will play automatically if you assign a [Custom Model](./files/custom_assets?id=_3d-models) to the player model that contains those clips. Check the **Class Config** documentation to learn how.

___

If you want to play animations through the server and all clients, please refer to the [Multiplayer & Networking](./files/multiplayer_&_networking) section.

<br><br/>

## Sounds & Music

Sound is a very important aspect of any game. In Krunker you have a few options when it comes to playing sounds (only .mp3 is supported):

___

**Using KrunkScript:**

<p class="hidep"><strong class="client-side">client-side</strong></p>

```krunkscript
# play sound in 2D space (sound id, volume, looping)
GAME.SOUND.play2D(
    id, # num
    vol, # num 0.1 - 1
    loop # bool
);

# play sound in 3D space (sound id, volume, looping, position)
GAME.SOUND.play3D(
    id, # num
    vol, # num
    x, # num
    y, # num
    z, # num
    rate, # num
    loop # bool
);
```

___

**Using Triggers:** You can use the following [Trigger Actions](./files/trigger_logic?id=trigger-actions) to interact with sounds:
 * **Broadcast Sound**: Emit sound to entire server
 * **Send Sound**: Emit sound to specific player
 * **Stop Sound**: Stop sound by id
For more information on using triggers, refer to the [Triggers](./files/trigger_logic) section.

___

Krunker also has a few default sounds such as footsteps, jumping sounds etc. If you want to override or disable them, you can use a [Resource Pack](./files/mod-resource_packs?id=custom-css).

___

If you want to play sounds/audio through the server and all clients, please refer to the [Multiplayer & Networking](./files/multiplayer_&_networking) section.

<br><br/>

## Scripts

A script is used to calculate and apply logic to your game.

```krunkscript
num test = 10;
num action calc(num val) {
    return test * val;
}
GAME.log(calc(5)); # logs 50
```

To learn more about scripts, refer to the [Scripting](./files/scripting) section of the documentation.
